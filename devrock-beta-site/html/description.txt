This is hiconic-os.org's update site for the BETA versions of devrock's offering for Eclipse.

While these plugins have been all been tested (and already used daily), they are officially classified as BETA versions, may not fully reflect the features of the RELEASE versions, and - finally - may contain issues that haven't been detected yet.

Still, using the BETA versions gives you access the newest features and bug fixes, and by using them, you help to gather information that makes publishing a RELEASE faster and more reliable.

So, if you do choose to install these BETA versions - thank you.
